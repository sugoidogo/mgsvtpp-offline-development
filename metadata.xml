  <Description>This mod enables online-only items for offline development and changes development requirements to better match an offline mode playthrough.

- All items have their level requirements changed to max out at level 61 for grade 15 gear, which is the level reached with 100 S-rank crew in each department.
- Online items which don't normally have proper development requirements set by the game for offline mode have been given costs calculated based on their equipment grade.
- Plant Development Costs have been re-calculated to stay under the offline maximum of 6k</Description>
